# Hi there 👋

🔭 I’m Mason, a Full Stack Software Engineer and Entrepreneur.

🌱 I have co-founded multiple businesses and worked in varying roles from Web Developer to Chief Technical Officer over the last 10 years.   

🤔 These experiences have deeply routed in me a consumer first approach when it comes to development.  I have seen first-hand how vital customer retention and little details with the user experience can impact your business' success.

📚🏕️ I have a passion for learning and the outdoors.   

⚡ Fun fact: I have a 600+ day streak on Duolingo
